# {lscr}

{lscr} is an open-source web proxy service that lets you browse the web without distractions like ads, popups, and banners. It's strongly inspired by 12ft.io, but created with the belief that an open source alternative is necessary. The service works by disabling JavaScript on webpages, which removes many modern web annoyances.

## Features

- **Clean Browsing**: Removes ads, popups, subscription walls, and other distractions from webpages
- **Easy to Use**: Simply prepend `lscr.xyz/` to any URL or use the web interface
- **Fast Loading**: Pages load faster without JavaScript overhead
- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and improve

## How It Works

{lscr} works by:

1. Taking a URL you want to view
2. Fetching the page content server-side
3. Removing all JavaScript
4. Serving you a clean, distraction-free version of the page

This approach effectively bypasses many paywalls and popup overlays that rely on JavaScript to enforce restrictions.

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Visit [lscr.xyz](https://lscr.xyz)
2. Enter the URL you want to clean in the input field
3. Click "Clean Webpage"

### Direct URL Method

Simply prepend `lscr.xyz/` to any URL:

```
https://lscr.xyz/https://example.com/article
```

## Limitations

- Some websites rely heavily on JavaScript for core functionality and may not work correctly
- Dynamic content loaded after page load will not appear
- Some interactive elements may not function as expected
